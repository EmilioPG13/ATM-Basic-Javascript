I was instructed to create a web application with JavaScript where I simulate the interaction with an ATM.


When you enter the ATM, you can select the account you want to interact with. There must be at least three accounts:

- Person 1
- Person 2
- Person 3

When selecting an account, you must enter the password associated with the account. If the password is incorrect, you must notify the user and allow them to try again.
If the password is correct, you must display the following options:

- Check balance
- Enter Amount
- Withdraw Amount

* When selecting check balance, the current balance of the account should be displayed on the screen.
* When selecting enter amount, the user must type the amount to enter. When entering the amount, it should show the user the amount entered and the new total balance.
* When selecting withdraw amount, the user must type the amount to withdraw. When withdrawing the amount, you must show the user the amount withdrawn and the new total balance.

As a business rule, an account should not have more than $990 and less than $10. It is necessary to make the pertinent validations so that this business rule is not broken.
